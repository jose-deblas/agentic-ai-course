    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools‚Äîsuch as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you‚Äôll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML‚Äîlaying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

      "It seems there are currently no specific results directly from arXiv or the web from the initial search attempts concerning \"radio observations of recurrent novae.\" However, I can provide a general overview based on existing knowledge and contextual understanding of the topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview of Recurrent Novae and Radio Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "### What are Recurrent Novae?\n",
      "Recurrent novae are a subtype of nova systems that experience repeated outbursts. These systems typically consist of a white dwarf and a companion star. The white dwarf accrues material from the companion, leading to periodic thermonuclear explosions on its surface. These explosions result in a dramatic increase in brightness, and unlike classical novae, recurrent novae outburst multiple times on human timescales.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Importance of Radio Observations\n",
      "Radio observations of novae, including recurrent novae, provide crucial insights into the properties of the ejecta during the outburst phase. The radio frequencies allow astronomers to penetrate the dense initial ejecta, offering a view of the material that is otherwise obscured in optical wavelengths. This helps in determining the ejecta's mass, velocity, and structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Findings in Radio Observations\n",
      "1. **Post-Outburst Behavior**: Radio emissions often help in tracking the expansion velocity of the ejected shell, which can be compared with theoretical models to understand the physics governing the explosion.\n",
      "2. **Diagnostics of Ejected Material**: Through radio observations, researchers can measure the size and geometrical configuration of the ejected material, determining whether it is spherical, disk-like, or bipolar.\n",
      "3. **Shock Interactions**: As the ejected material interacts with pre-existing matter around the nova system, shock fronts develop, which can be effectively studied in radio frequencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Challenges and Future Research\n",
      "The recording and analysis of radio emissions are crucial since they can differ significantly between events in the same system due to changes in the accreted material and modifications in the binary components. Continued advances in radio astronomy technologies and the increase of radio telescopes worldwide improve the ability to monitor and understand these energetic cosmic phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of readily available recent studies specifically focusing on this topic might suggest a need for more targeted research in upcoming investigations. Researchers could benefit greatly from high-resolution observations from interferometers such as the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).\n",

       "    <p>Recurrent novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variable stars that undergo repeated nova outbursts. Unlike classical novae, which may only experience a single outburst, recurrent novae are characterized by multiple explosions over the course of several decades. This episodic behavior is largely due to the rapid build-up and subsequent ignition of hydrogen on the surface of a white dwarf accreting material from a companion star.</p>\n",
